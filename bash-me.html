	<p>My name is Nate Bennett, and I'm a student at the University of Colorado in Boulder, CO. I love exploring the outdoors and designing things to be better and more beautiful. In my free time, you can find me hiking, climbing, volunteering with a local outdoor rescue group, or spending time with my favorite people.</p>
	<p>So far, my only formal training for web development has been ATLS 2200, "Web." In that class, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and some Javascript. I think web design will only get more important as our world becomes increasingly digital, and love learning about how to make websites more intuitive, aesthetically pleasing and fun to use.</p>
	<p>In this class, I want to brush up on my web skills (which I am doing right now!) in addition to learning more advanced tools for making websites more efficient and interesting. For example, I am excited to learn how to use Git and Sass, as well as implementing features like parallax scrolling and wordpress.</p>
